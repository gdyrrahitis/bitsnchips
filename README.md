# BNC, Agile poker planning real-time application

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gdyrrahitis/pcard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gdyrrahitis/pcard)

## Synopsis

A real-time application for teams to make estimations using the agile poker planning technique.
Poker planning is all about estimation, so a poker planning session is about describing an agile story to team, with each individual (estimator), making estimations about this story.

Estimation is done through poker planning cards with values 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100 (mountain goat), each representing the number of story points in units that the team has agreed on. All estimations are revealed the same time.
If all estimators choose the same value this becomes the estimate. If estimates are different, they are discussed among the team with the highest and lowest giving their reasons. 
If needed, they reselect cards, making estimations again.

In this application a user can join rooms where other participates are awaiting to start poker planning sessions. The procedure descibed before is taking place, having the creator of the room as the moderator, essentially dictating the planning session, as well as managing connected participators.

Application is build with NodeJS, Express, Socket.io, AngularJS and SASS.
